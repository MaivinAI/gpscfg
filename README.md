# GPS Configuration Tool

Tool to configure and test u-blox GPS modules.

## Requirements

The tool requires a newer ublox library than the 0.4.2 release published on crates.io so we have it bundled as a git submodule.  Before building you'll need to pull the submodule.

```shell
git submodule update --init
```
